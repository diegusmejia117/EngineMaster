# EngineMaster
Repository containing a work in progress 3D GameEngine

Hi, i want to address my late github commit, i had a lot of problems uploading my project to the repository, so i worked locally until this commit, it also didn't helped that it is my first time working with Github.

i am already addressing that and i am taking extra care on learning github.


On november 14 /2022 i achieved to render my triangle using the class tutorial as reference and incorpated some basic camera movement(traslation, rotation)

All that week i was working on incorporatin imui in my project, having problems with external symbol erros from the Imgui library, achieving  rendering windows and menus.

and by November 28 /2022 i was stuck trying to render the baker house with texture.

By December 2 /2022, i am trying to implement mesh drop in and to fix and implement various imgui console problems as well as camera movment problems.
